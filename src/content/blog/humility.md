On a high-temperature night on 22nd March 2024, a profound level of introspection brought about two questions— one I could confidently answer and the other that caused me to panic.

`“Are you proud of how far you’ve come this year?”` Of course, I answered affirmatively.

`“Have you thought for a second how far you would have gone if you were slightly humble?”` I couldn’t answer this.

The vices are uncountable— from making horrible purchasing decisions to being lukewarm with my relationship with God and compromising some crucial relationships in my life because I couldn’t keep my ego(tongue) in check.

One of my most significant flaws is prioritizing my skills and abilities and seeing people with less capacity than me as lazy or lost. The dire need to prove myself has made me averse to asking for help.

It is okay to be stupid and ask for help, but I have "a big head.”

As put by the wisest man to ever live in the book of Proverbs chapter 11, verse 2, `humility leads to wisdom.` This priceless lesson has eluded me.

You may think reading `Ego is the Enemy` is a sure way to kill the said enemy, yet all the powerful lessons I picked in the book have faded into oblivion with each passing time.

Back to the “introspective night” of March 22, I asked 4 of the closest people I’m not related to by blood but know me to a greater degree. To my surprise, none of them admitted that I lack humility. They praised me instead.

Just when I was about to smile and thank God that I’m not as egotistic as I think I am, I remembered Ryan Holiday’s argument in his book where he discusses the subtleties of ego and that the mere act of believing one lacks ego can ironically be a manifestation of ego itself.

> Ego often operates subtly, leading individuals to believe they are immune to its effects or have transcended it. This false sense of superiority or immunity from ego blinds individuals to their faults and impedes their growth.

I promptly googled for prayers and biblical references to humility. To my surprise, I realized that pride, ego, and humility are profoundly documented topics in the Bible.

One story that captured my interest recounts the encounter between Jesus and a Centurion seeking healing for his ailing servant (Matthew 8:5-13). Remarkably, the Centurion displayed extraordinary humility(and faith), insisting that Jesus need not physically enter his home to perform the miracle; a mere word from Jesus would suffice. Jesus, recognizing the Centurion's faith and humility, declared, `Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith.`

**Can you now recognize the intimate link between Faith and Humility?**

Within the Catholic Church, the faithful recite a poignant prayer known as the `Prayer of Humble Access` before partaking in Communion during Mass.

It commences with the following words:

> Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof, but only say the word, and my soul shall be healed.

This prayer is a direct counterweight to the ego, often luring individuals into overestimating their righteousness and worthiness. Openly admitting one’s unworthiness quells the ego’s inclination toward self-importance and pride.

Divine blessings are intricately tied to humility. Throughout the Bible, humility consistently emerges as a virtue that garners favor with God, while pride and arrogance are sternly condemned.

- **Moses** - `Numbers 12:3: "Now Moses was a very humble man, more humble than anyone else on the face of the earth."`
- **Solomon** - `1 Kings 3:7-14`: God granted Solomon wisdom and riches because he asked for understanding to govern God's people with humility.
- **Hezekiah** - `2 Kings 20:1-7`: God extended Hezekiah's life and delivered Judah from Assyrian invasion because of Hezekiah's humility and prayers.
- **Job** - `Job 1:1-3`: Job's humility and righteousness were evident in his response to suffering, acknowledging God's sovereignty and maintaining his faith.
- **Mary, the mother of Jesus** - `Luke 1:48`: Mary's humility is extolled in her Magnificat, where she acknowledges her lowly state and God's greatness.
- **John the Baptist** - `John 3:30`: John humbly recognized his role with Jesus, saying, `He must become greater and greater; I must become less and less.`
- **The Centurion** - `Matthew 8:5-13`: Jesus commended the Centurion for his profound faith and humility, declaring, `Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith.`

In numerous instances, God interacts with proud and egotistical individuals to caution and chasten them.

In the book of Exodus, Pharaoh's arrogance and obstinacy led to his downfall as he refused to release the Israelites despite the plagues wrought by God through Moses `(Exodus 5-14)`.

Similarly, Nebuchadnezzar endured a period of madness as punishment for his pride and haughtiness `(Daniel 4)`. Through God’s intervention, he acknowledged divine sovereignty, leading to his restoration.

King Herod Agrippa I, praised by his subjects as a god, faced swift divine retribution in Acts 12:21-23. He perished because he failed to give glory to God.

These instances illustrate that while God may engage with proud individuals, it is often to correct, judge, or impart a lesson in humility rather than to bestow blessings.

## What I intend to do(you can too):

### 1. Self-awareness

A practical application is regularly reflecting on your thoughts and actions. Ask for feedback from friends, mentors, or colleagues.

Recognize the insidious nature of ego and its potential to hinder personal and professional growth.

> Proverbs 11:2 advises that pride leads to disgrace, but humility brings wisdom.

### 2. Embrace a Servant Mindset

Seek opportunities to help and support others. Listen actively, offer assistance without expecting recognition, and prioritize collaboration over personal glory.

Understand and love that you are stupid, you know nothing, and that’s okay. Shift focus from self-promotion to serving others, recognizing that true greatness comes from humility and service.

> Philippians 2:3- 4 encourages humility and considers others' interests more significant than yours.

### 3. Gratitude and Contentment

Acknowledge and appreciate the blessings in your life, both big and small. Gratitude counteracts the sense of entitlement and dissatisfaction that often accompanies ego-driven desires.

This may sound cliche, but it is timeless advice: `Avoid comparing yourself to others and focus on being content with what you have rather than constantly striving for more.` Know when enough is enough and when to stop.

> 1 Thessalonians 5:18 encourages giving thanks in all circumstances, recognizing blessings as gifts from God.

### 4. Surrender to God's Will

Know the limits of your understanding and seek guidance from mentors, wise counsel, and, for believers, God.

Surrender your desires and plans to align with God's will in all aspects of your life.

> James 4:10 advises humbling oneself before the Lord, acknowledging God's sovereignty, and seeking His will.

Shalom!
