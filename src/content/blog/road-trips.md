Negotiating isn’t just about reaching a compromise; it’s about engaging in a deeply personal, often transformative, conversation with the divine.

Faced with the impending destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, good old Abraham engages in a daring negotiation with God, pleading for mercy even if a few righteous people are found within the cities. (Genesis 18:22-33)

In business, parties with the most leverage — which can be in power, resources, or even options win negotiations, but the Word proves the contrary.

Using the mundane definition of `“negotiation”` as a benchmark, Abraham had zero leverage, yet he successfully engaged in `six rounds of back-and-forth with Him`. The city was ultimately destroyed, yet Abraham won the negotiation. Or at least his nephew, Lot, got spared. Could you answer why Abraham won?

Hezekiah received 15 years added to his life because he served God and man wholeheartedly, believed he deserved more, and had the guts to ask for more.

Jacob wrestled with God, which ultimately cost him his legs, yet he won.

Moses provided God with good arguments for keeping His promises and not destroying the people He brought out of exile and the tyrannical power of the Pharaohs.

Solomon loved to serve so much that when God descended on him in his slumber, he requested wisdom, which eventually earned him all the great things he never asked for.

Job pleaded with God regarding the suffering and injustices he perceived, feeling underserved of his plights. God eventually responds to Job’s questions. Even in moments of personal anguish and despair, negotiation with God becomes a means of finding solace and strength. Job questions and pleads with God in his suffering, seeking understanding and resolution (Job 38-42). His willingness to engage in dialogue, despite the enormity of his pain, reflects a profound trust in the divine and a refusal to surrender to despair.

Despite their unique circumstances and personalities, their stories reflect a profound commitment to loving and serving God with all their hearts, minds, and souls.

Relating their experiences to what Jesus said is the greatest commandment, we find a striking resonance.

In Matthew 22:37-40, Jesus declares:

> "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, and mind. This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: Love your neighbor as yourself. All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments."

Moses, Abraham, Hezekiah, Jacob, Job, and Solomon exemplify this greatest commandment through their unwavering devotion to God. Their lives reflect a wholehearted love for the divine, expressed through their actions, prayers, and willingness to dialogue and negotiate with God.

Furthermore, their compassion, empathy, and concern for others—interceding for their people or advocating for justice—underscore the interconnectedness of loving God and loving neighbor.

These biblical figures’ experiences echo the timeless wisdom of Jesus' teachings, illustrating the transformative power of wholehearted love for God and neighbor. Abraham interceded for the people of Sodom and Gomorrah. Solomon and Moses, for the people of Israel.

Through their lives, they exemplify the profound truth that all aspects of the Law and the Prophets ultimately find fulfillment in the commandment to love.

To enter into a negotiation with God and "win," so to speak, we need two key things:

- Faith is a deep and unwavering belief in the power of prayer, the divine's ability to intervene, and the sincerity of your intentions. Faith forms the foundation of any negotiation with God, anchoring your trust in His wisdom, mercy, and grace.

- Humility is an attitude that acknowledges one’s limitations, shortcomings, and dependence on God’s guidance and grace. It opens the door to genuine dialogue with the divine, allowing one to approach God with reverence, honesty, and openness.

Imagine a vast desert expanse where the sun beats down relentlessly, and the horizon stretches endlessly. In this land, where survival hangs in the balance, negotiation becomes not just a skill but a lifeline— a way to plead for mercy and forge a path forward.

With faith and humility as your guiding principles, you can confidently negotiate with God, knowing that your petitions are heard and your heart is open to His will.

While the outcome of such negotiations may not always align with your desires, engaging in dialogue with the divine can lead to spiritual growth, insight, and transformation.
