My name is Michael Asiedu. I'm fit and Christian.

I'm currently a Developer Advocate for [the Cartesi Project](https://cartesi.io).

My biggest dream since I was 12 is to become a father.

Most of my time is spent leading documentation around the Cartesi project and lifting weights. One colleague once called me _"doc lord,"_ and I loved it.

My biggest strength as a software engineer is to find something entirely unique and obscure, comprehend and write about it in a way an 8th grader will assimilate, and make it known.

## Interests

My favorite programming languages are Rust, Python and JavaScript, and I've been building software since I was 18.

I'm learning video making and cinematography, a passion I will profoundly pursue in the next few years.

## Courses

My team recently launched a free 1.5-hour course to help developers build computationally extensive dApps on Cartesi.

Check it out [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-cartesi-dapp-developer-masterclass).
